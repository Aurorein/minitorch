# MiniTorch

MiniTorch is a diy teaching library for machine learning engineers who wish to learn about the internal concepts underlying deep learning systems. It is a pure Python re-implementation of the Torch API designed to be simple, easy-to-read, tested, and incremental. The final library can run Torch code.

This is the student repository for the project, implemented up until and partially including fast CUDA and parallel computation using NUMBA. More info at <https://minitorch.github.io/>.
